This work explains how OR and ML in tandem can help us making a cost efficient decisions. I have used a Supply Chain Network Design use case to explain benefits of ML+OR together.

## Problem Statement
Comapny __A__ sell the __Finished Good (FG)__ to its customers. The FG is made of __Part-1__ and __Part-2__. Part-1 is manufactured at location $\mathbb{LOC}$ and Part-2 is sourced from a supplier. Then Part-1 & Part-2 is assembled, this assembly of the products involve certain cost.

Once the product is assembled, it is shipped to the customers using parcel delivery. Now the company __A__ is looking to establish the Distribution Centres(DCs) to benefit from the economies of scale shippment to DC and different assembly costs at different DC. The main objective is to idetify the number and location of DCs to located across the country at a minimum total cost. The total cost includes the operating cost of DC, assembly cost, and shipment costs.
